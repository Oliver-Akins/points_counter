            <h3>About</h3>
            This bot was created to be able to track points of whatever you want
            on your stream. I do not offer support for getting the
            bot running on your server. If you cannot get it running yourself, I
            do not have the time to help you. It's fairly simple to get running
            for yourself.

            <h3>Running the Bot</h3>
            <p>
                This bot is entirely self-hosted, there is no bot that you can
                just add to your channel(s) for using it. I also have no plans
                to ever host this bot that way. To run the bot you will want to
                compile the TS to JS using tsc after installing the Node
                dependencies using
                <code>npm i</code>.
                Fill in the config file, then run
                <code>dist/main.js</code>
                with the
                <code>--compile-docs</code>
                option. Then run the same file with whatever other arguments
                you want to specify for the services you want to have the bot
                in.

            Warning: No support is given to users about how to host the bot
            on their own. I do not have enough time to help people maintain
            their own versions of the bot.
