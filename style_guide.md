# Style Guide:

Variable naming: `snake_case`

Constant naming: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

Functions should all be declared using `const` with fat-arrow syntax, and should be typed strictly.

All JSON data should be typed, and loaded by a function, not imported.

There should be two blank lines after copyright/author header.
